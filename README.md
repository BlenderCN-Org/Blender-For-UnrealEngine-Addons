# Blender For Unreal Engine 4

Working on object packs for Unreal Engine 4 can be complicated with Blender. That's why I created the Addons "Blender for UnrealEngine". It simplifies the procedure of the export, allows to export all the Assets of a scene at the same time, distributed them in a proper tree structure in correlation with the UnrealEngine Pipeline.

- No need to place the object in the center of the scene in different layers to see something. Objects will export using their own origin - point as origin instead of the scene.
- It is possible to choose for each object how it should be exported.
- About SkeletalMesh it is possible to choose precisely the different animations that need to be exported.
- The addon also allows you to add Collisions Shapes and Socket to your StaticMesh directly in Blender
- Also includes a potential error checker to avoid problems with exporting.
- This Addon was created for Unreal Engine 4, but it also works for any other game engine that handles fbx files. The nomenclature being - - modifiable you can use any naming convention for organizing your assets.
- You can also choose which type of assets should be exported.
