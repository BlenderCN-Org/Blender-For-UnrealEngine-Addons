# Blender For Unreal Engine
This addons allows you to export content created with Blender to Unreal Engine 4.

# How it works
Working on object packs for Unreal Engine 4 can be complicated with Blender. That's why I created the Addons "Blender for UnrealEngine". It simplifies the procedure of the export, allows to export all the Assets of a scene at the same time, distributed them in a proper tree structure in correlation with the UnrealEngine Pipeline.

The socket and collision shapes is done directly in Blender.
You can choose precisely the different animations that need to be exported.
Also the addon includes a potential error checker to avoid problems with exporting.
And since the last version it is possible to generate scripts for unreal who will import the assets or generate level sequencer.
