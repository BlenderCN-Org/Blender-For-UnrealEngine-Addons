# Blender For Unreal Engine 4

Working on object packs for Unreal Engine 4 can be complicated with Blender. That's why I created the Addons "Blender for UnrealEngine". It simplifies the procedure of the export, allows to export all the Assets of a scene at the same time, distributed them in a proper tree structure in correlation with the UnrealEngine Pipeline.

No need to place the object in the center of the scene in different layers to see something. Objects will export using their own origin point as origin instead of the scene.
